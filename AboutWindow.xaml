One player has the dark pieces (usually black); the other has the light pieces (usually white or red). Players alternate turns. A player can not move an opponent's pieces. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used. A piece can only move diagonally into an unoccupied square. When capturing an opponent's piece is possible, capturing is mandatory in most official rules. If the player does not capture, the other player can remove the opponent's piece as penalty (or muffin). And where there are two or more such positions, the player forfeits pieces that cannot be moved. Although some rule variations make capturing optional.[3] In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Men"/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Uncrowned pieces (men) move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may &quot;zigzag&quot; (change diagonal direction). In American checkers men can jump only forwards; in international draughts and Russian draughts men can jump both forwards and backwards."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Kings "/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="A game in international draughts (10×10 board), featuring a flying king (the move &quot;Les Blancs prennent 6 pions...&quot;)"/><LineBreak/><Run Text="When a man reaches the kings row (also called crownhead, the farthest row forward), it becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man (crowned), and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="In international draughts, kings (also called flying kings) move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped."/><LineBreak/></TextBlock>
